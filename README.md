# Project Title: Detection of Suicidal Texts

## Project Description
This project aims to develop a text classification model to identify suicidal texts. The model is trained on a dataset containing both suicidal and non-suicidal texts. Different machine learning algorithms are explored, including Random Forest, Naive Bayes, XGBoost and K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), to find the most effective approach for this classification task.

## Installation
1. Clone the repository to your local machine:
    git clone https://github.com/zehra-demir/Group_4.git

2. Install the required libraries:
    pip install -r requirements.txt

3. Open the project.ipynb notebook using Jupyter Notebook or Visual Studio Code.

4. Now by running cells, you can see how algorithms are trained. After that, you can check some texts if they contain harmful content by using our the demo part in the notebook.

### Warning: The results of the given texts or may or may not be correct. Remember this is just a project and does not mean the prediction is reliable.
